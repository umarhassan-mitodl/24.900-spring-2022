  caption: A portion of the 23rd Psalm, as translated by John Eliot into the language
    of the indigenous Wampanoag people of Massachusetts in the late 16th century.
    In the 21st century, that translation and other surviving written documents have
    formed the basis for efforts to re-establish Wampanoag as a living language. (Public
