  caption: A portion of the 23rd Psalm, as translated by John Eliot into the language
    of the Wampanoag people of Massachusetts in the 17th century. In the 21st century,
    that translation and other surviving written documents have formed the basis for
    efforts to re-establish Wampanoag as a living language. (Public domain image courtesy
