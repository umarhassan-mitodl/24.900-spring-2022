**Due:** **Session 7**

**Length**: **Approximately 1000 words (≈ 4 pages, double-spaced)**

For the first paper in this class, you will read a published article that makes a claim about language, and write a short critical paper that summarizes and evaluates the authors’ claim. In order to do this, you will need to consider the evidence that is put forward in support of the claim and discuss the strengths and weaknesses of the authors’ evidence and arguments.

The articles that you may choose from are listed below and can be accessed under “Assignment 1: Critical Summary Articles.”

A well-written paper should:

- concisely summarize the main claim of the paper,
- describe the key evidence that is presented in support of the claim,
- evaluate whether the evidence confirms the researchers’ claim, or whether there might be other possible interpretations of the findings, and,
- explain what broader and deeper questions about language are engaged by the research reported in the paper; in other words, why are the authors’ results interesting (or not) as part of a broader agenda of research on language?

In addition, the paper should do *one or more* of the following:

- If the evidence is ambiguous or insufficient to confirm the claim, discuss what type of data would be helpful in order to distinguish between the competing hypotheses or interpretations.
- If the evidence actually seems to support a different interpretation than the one that is advanced in the article, provide an argument for why we should draw a different conclusion from what the authors advocate.
- Discuss possible implications of the finding, if you believe it is true. For example: what further predictions might we make, based on this result? What are some new hypotheses that we might make, and what sorts of additional data might we want to collect to test them?

You are not expected to do any research or consult other sources of information for this assignment.

Be sure to cite page numbers of any quotations from the article. A full bibliographic APA citation of the article should appear at the end of the essay. Please keep your paper to approximately 1000 words (not counting the bibliographic citation).

## Articles to choose from:

Berent, I., Lennertz, T., Jun J., Moreno, M. & Smolensky, P. (2008). Language Universals in Human Brains. *PNAS* 105(14): 5321–5325.

Culbertson, J., & Adger, D. (2014). Language learners privilege structured meaning over surface frequency. *PNAS* 111(16): 5842–5847.

These articles do have some technical content, but they are not intended solely for readers with a strong background in Linguistics. Although there will be some technical terms and details of the analysis that go beyond what you have studied so far, you should be able to grasp the central ideas and claims of the article, which is all that we are expecting. If you are uncertain as to whether you are interpreting a technical term or analysis correctly, you can simply indicate this, and proceed on the assumption that you are correct. It is also fine to ask the instructor or a TA to verify your interpretation.
