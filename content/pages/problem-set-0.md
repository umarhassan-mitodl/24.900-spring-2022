Due: Session 3

Tell us about yourself: what got you interested in this class? what are you hoping to get out of it? 

and: 

- Find a native speaker of a language you don't know (i.e., do not speak, have never studied), who would be willing to work with you for up to five one-hour sessions throughout the semester. 
- Submit to us in writing:     
    o The language name, and where your speaker is from     
    o The name of the language, as native speakers refer to it     
    o The classification (linguistic affiliation) of the language—i.e., what language family it belongs to. 

Answers to frequently asked questions:

- What if you are a native speaker of a language other than English?     
    o You must still find a speaker of a language you do not know (i.e., you cannot use yourself).     
    o However, you may act as the speaker for someone else in the class. 
- What if you want to study Klingon, Sindarin, etc.?     
    o If you can find a native speaker of Klingon, feel free to use them. Be very careful.
